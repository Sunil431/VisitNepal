</div>
 <p>

You will come across stories of Gods and Goddesses as you walk the streets and alleys of Nepal.<br> Where each day is a celebration of life, there are numerous festivals throughout the year.<br> The sounds of drums and cymbals, the flute players, the masked dancers and the quiet hum of sacred chants permeate the air in processions and parades that celebrate the culture and heritage of the nation<br>.
Nepal is home of the living Goddess, the Kumari – a manifestation of female divinity, who is venerated and worshiped by devotees across the country.
